# Steps: Conference RAG Assignment

This folder contains step-by-step guides for building the Conference RAG application.

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide covers **what you need to learn** and **what you need to do** for that step. They are designed to be followed with an **AI coding assistant** (Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor) — the AI can help you write code, debug issues, and explain concepts.

## Your Journey

## Tips

- **Read the "What You'll Learn" section first** to understand the concepts before jumping into setup
- **Use your AI assistant liberally** — ask it to explain things, debug errors, and generate code
- **Don't skip verification steps** — each step has a way to confirm it worked before moving on
- **Celebrate milestones!** Each green light is real progress
